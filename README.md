This blog is my place to give commentary to my hacks and practice my writing.

# How this works

I write files in
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). I use
[Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) to turn them to HTML. I check them
into [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) following the
[Pelican Docs](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.1.1/tips.html).
